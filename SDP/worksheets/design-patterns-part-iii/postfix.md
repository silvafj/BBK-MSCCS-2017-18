# Postfix notation

If you donâ€™t know about postfix, here is a brief introduction. 
There are three notations for a mathematical expression i.e., 

1. infix, 
2. postfix, and 
3. prefix.

### Infix notation 

is the common arithmetic and logical formula notation, in which operators are written infix-style 
between the operands they act on e.g. 3 + 4.

### Postfix a.k.a. Reverse Polish notation (RPN) 

is mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands e.g. 34+.

### Prefix (Polish notation) 

is a form of notation for logic, arithmetic, and algebra in which operators to the left of their 
operands e.g. +34.

Infix notation is a normally used in mathematical expressions. 
The other two notations are used as syntax for mathematical expressions by interpreters of 
programming languages.
