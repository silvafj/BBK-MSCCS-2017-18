      You are in a lunar module, some distance above the Moon's surface.

      Gravity is pulling you toward the Moon at an ever-increasing rate
      of speed.

      You have a limited amount of fuel to use, and each time you burn
      fuel, you reduce your speed by a certain amount. If you burn the
      right amount of fuel at the right time, you can land safely.
