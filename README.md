# Worksheet-One
Worksheet One for Principle of Programming I

There are usually several ways to solve most programming exercises so just get something to work first and then refine it (refactor).

Always experiment when you are trying out a new feature and do look at other questions and exercises above and beyond the worksheets. 
Programming is all about practice and experience, and you don’t get that by doing the minimum.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mis- takes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens 
if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell print wrong?

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean. 
It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.

# General

1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?
2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?
3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?
4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?
5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?
