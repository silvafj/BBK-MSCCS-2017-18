# Worksheet-One
Worksheet One for Principle of Programming I

There are usually several ways to solve most programming exercises so just get something to work first and then refine it (refactor).

Always experiment when you are trying out a new feature and do look at other questions and exercises above and beyond the worksheets. 
Programming is all about practice and experience, and you don’t get that by doing the minimum.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mis- takes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens 
if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell print wrong?

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean. 
It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.

# General

1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?
2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?
3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?
4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?
5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

# Python as a calculator

Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.

6. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
7. How many miles are there in 10 kilometres? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometres in a mile.
8. If you run a 10 kilometre race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?
9. We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
10. Howabout x = y = 1?
11. In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ";". What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
12. What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
13. In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?
14. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
15. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 
What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
16. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, 
what time do I get home for breakfast?
