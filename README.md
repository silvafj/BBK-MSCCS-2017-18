# Worksheet on the functional programming constructs available in Java

## Lambda expressions in Java

## Learning goals

Before the next session, you should have achieved the following learning goals:

+ To work with the `Arrays` class.
+ To understand the flexibility of the *new* lambda forms available from Java 8 onwards.
+ To write simple lambda expressions using the Java 8+ syntax.
+ To use *method references*.
+ To gain experience using `Predicate`.

You should be able to finish most of non-star exercises during the lab session. 
Remember that star exercises are more difficult. 
Do not attempt star-exercises unless the other exercises are clear to you.

## Preamble

The `Arrays` class provides a number of static utility methods for manipulating arrays. 
For example, to print out an array, consider using `Arrays.asList`. 
The point of this is that if you just print an array directly, you do not see anything useful 
(just the type and memory address), but if you print a `List`, 
it shows the individual elements separated by commas 
(it is simpler than creating a loop to traverse the array and print out the elements).

The following exercises presume that you have a main class containing an array which you then 
pass to the `Arrays.sort` method. For example, initially the class might look something like the following:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Outline {
  public static void main(String... args) { // varargs alternative to String[]
    Integer[] intArray = {1,7,3,4,8,2};
    System.out.println(Arrays.asList(intArray));
    // Arrays.sort(intArray,.......)
  } 
}
```

## The Exercises

All of the exercises should be answered using Java 8+ lambda expressions unless specified otherwise.

1. Create an array containing some `String`s. Sort the array by
	+ length (i.e., shortest to longest)
	+ reverse length (i.e., longest to shortest)
	+ first character
	+ Strings that contain `"e"` first, everything else second.
	
   Remember that the `compare` method of `Comparator` should return a negative number 
   if the first entry is less than the second, a positive number if the first entry is greater 
   than the second, and 0 if they are the same. See the `JavaDoc` API for details.
   
2. For the last sorting example (strings with `"e"` first), 
   move the logic that computes the number to a separate `static` method. For example,
   
   ```java
   StringUtils.eChecker(s1, s2)
   ```
   will return
   + -1 if `s1` is less (i.e., it contains `"e"` but `s2` doesnâ€™t),
   + 1 if `s1` is greater, and
   + 0 otherwise.
   
   Now, rewrite the final lambda sorting example, but use a method reference in place of an explicit lambda.

3.  Create a class with a `static` method called `betterString`. 
      This method should take two `String`s and a lambda as its arguments. 
      This lambda states whether the first of the two strings is *better*.
   
      The method should return the *better* string; i.e., if the lambda returns `true` 
      the method should return the first string, otherwise it should return the second string.

      For the lambda, define an interface called `TwoStringPredicate` with a method that takes two `String`s 
      and returns `true` if the first is better than the second, `false` otherwise.
   
      Here are two examples (the first returns whichever of `test1` and `test2` is longer, 
      and the second always returns `test1`):
   		+ `StringUtils.betterString(test1, test2, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() > s2.length())`
   		+ `StringUtils.betterString(test1, test2, (s1, s2) -> true)`
	
4. Use generics to replace `betterString` with `betterEntry` and `TwoStringPredicate` 
   with `TwoElementPredicate`. Make sure your previous examples still work when you only change 
   `betterString` to `betterElement`.
   
5. (*) Create a `static` method called `allMatches`. It should take a `List` of `String`s 
   and a `Predicate<String>`, and return a new `List` of all the values that passed the test. 
   Test it with several examples. For example:
   ```java
   List<String> shortWords = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> s.length() < 4);
  List<String> wordsWithB = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> s.contains("b"));
  List<String> evenLengthWords = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> (s.length() % 2) == 0);
   ```
6. (**) Rewrite `allMatches` so it works on any `List` and associated `Predicate`, 
   not just on `String`s. Verify that the examples from the previous question still work.
   
7. (*) Create a `static` method called `transformedList`. It should take a `List` of `String`s 
   and a `Function<String,String>` and return a new `List` that contains the results of 
   applying the function to each element of the original list. For example:
   ```java
   List<String> excitingWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, s -> s + "!");
   List<String> eyeWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, s -> s.replace("i", "eye"));
   List<String> upperCaseWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, String::toUpperCase);
   ```
	
8.	(**) Rewrite `transformedList` so it works with generic types. 
   Verify that the examples from the previous question still work.
