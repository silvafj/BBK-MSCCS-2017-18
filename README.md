# Worksheet-One
Worksheet One for Principle of Programming I

These are quite simple exercises which would usually be attempted in session one. The reason for including them here is so that you can concentrate on using
Git and GitHub (and therefore, GitHub Classroom). It is also for us to check that your submissions are arriving at GitHub Classroom. You do not need to attempt 
all the exercises if you consider you are comfortable with the materials; in that case only attempt the "*" items.

There are usually several ways to solve most programming exercises so just get something to work first and then refine it (refactor).

Always experiment when you are trying out a new feature and do look at other questions and exercises above and beyond the worksheets. 
Programming is all about practice and experience, and you don’t get that by doing the minimum.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mis- takes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens 
if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell print wrong?

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean. 
It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.

# General

1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?
2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?
3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?
4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?
5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

# Python as a calculator

Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.

6. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
7. How many miles are there in 10 kilometres? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometres in a mile.
8. If you run a 10 kilometre race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?
9. We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
10. Howabout x = y = 1?
11. In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ";". What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
12. What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
13. In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?
14. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
15. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 
What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
16. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, 
what time do I get home for breakfast?

# Functions

17. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.
   >>> right_justify('monty')
monty
Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('monty') is 5.
18. A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
   def do_twice(f):
       f()
f()
Here’s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice. def print_spam():
       print('spam')
   do_twice(print_spam)
Type this example into a script and test it.
19. Modifydo_twicesothatittakestwoarguments,afunctionobjectandavalue,and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
20. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.
21. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam'
as an argument.
22. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. 
There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.

# Supplemental

23. Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
+----+----+ ||| ||| ||| ||| +----+----+ ||| ||| ||| ||| +----+----+
Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence of values:
print('+', '-')
By default, print advances to the next line, but you can override that behavior
and put a space at the end, like this:
   print('+', end=' ')
   print('-')
The output of these statements is '+ -'.
A print statement with no argument ends the current line and goes to the next
line.
24. Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.
25. Write a program that prints your full name and your birthday as separate strings
26. Write a program that shows the use of all seven math functions
