# If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the
# quotation marks, or both?

If we leave out both quotation marks there are three possible scenarios:
(1) the string is a defined variable and we will print the value of it
(2) the string is not a defined variable and it will crash/complain at runtime
(3) the string contains spaces and it will cause syntax error

If we leave out just one of the quotation marks it will cause syntax error.
