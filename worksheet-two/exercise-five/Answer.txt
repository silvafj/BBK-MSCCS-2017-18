Q: Can you ever have a mutator method return something other than void?

Yes. We can have a mutator that can return a boolean (to signify success of theoperation) or a instance of the current
class allowing us to nest calls to the same instance.


Q: Can you ever have an accessor method return void?

No. An accessor method implies returning a value of a private member variable.
