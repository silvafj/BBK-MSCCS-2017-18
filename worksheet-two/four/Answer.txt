Q: Consider the nextInt method of the Scanner class. Is it an accessor or mutator? Why?
   What about the nextInt method of the Random class?

nextInt() method both in Scanner and Random classes is neither an accessor or mutator.

Accessor and mutator are also known as getter and setter. The getter is used to return the value of a private member
variable, while the setter provides us a way of altering the value of that private member variable.

Taking this as the definition, we conclude that nextInt() (on both classes) does much more than just returning a value
from a private member variable. It performs other work like reading from the input stream or calculating a value based
on a seed.
