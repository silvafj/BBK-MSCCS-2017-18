           Two players take turns; on each turn, a player rolls a
           six-sided die  as many times as they  desire, or until
           they roll a 1.

           Each number  they  roll is  added to  their score this
           turn; but if they roll a 1, their score for  this turn
           is zero and their turn ends.

           At the end  of each  turn, the  score for that turn is
           added to the player's total score. The first player to
           reach or exceed 100 wins.

           If both players reach a tie break with  a score of 100
           or more, each gets another turn and the game continues
           until the tie is broken.

           You will play against the computer.

           The computer goes first...
